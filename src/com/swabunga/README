                         J A Z Z Y : Java Spell Checker


  What is it?
  -----------

  Jazzy is a 100% pure Java library implementing a spell checking algorithm
  similar to aspell. It may be used to spell check a variety of sources.

  The Latest Version
  ------------------

  The latest version is available from the Jazzy project web site 
  (http://sourceforge.net/projects/jazzy).

  Requirements
  ------------

  The following requirements exist for installing Jazzy:

   o  Java Interpreter:

      A fully compliant Java 1.1 Runtime environment is needed for the core engine of Jazzy 
      to operate. (For example: for use in a servlet)
      
      A fully compliant Java 1.3 Runtime environment is needed for the swing components of
      Jazzy to operate.

   o  Java JFC (Swing components):

      These GUI extentions are required for proper GUI functionality. However, core 
      spell check functionality can work without Swing Components. 

  Installation Instructions and Documentation
  -------------------------------------------

  There are two ways to install Jazzy. One from a pre packaged version and the other is to 
  compile the sources from CVS.

  If you have downloaded the source code from CVS, please cd to the jazzy directory and run ant.
