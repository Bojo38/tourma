              Apache Commons Net 3.6
                  RELEASE NOTES

The Apache Commons Net team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Commons Net 3.6

Apache Commons Net library contains a collection of network utilities and protocol implementations.
Supported protocols include: Echo, Finger, FTP, NNTP, NTP, POP3(S), SMTP(S), Telnet, Whois

This is mainly a bug-fix release. See further details below.

This release is binary compatible with previous releases.
However it is not source compatible with releases before 3.4, as some methods were added to the interface NtpV3Packet in 3.4

The code now requires a minimum of Java 1.6.

Changes to functionality:
* The FTP client now performs stricter checks on non-multiline command replies.
 The 3 digit code must now be followed by a space and some text, as per RFC 959.
 To suppress this stricter checking, call FTP#setStrictReplyParsing(false). This should not be needed with a well-behaved server.
 Note also that if strict checking is disabled, some functions may unconditionally strip the next character after the code, without checking it if is a space.
* The FTP client mlistFile() method now checks for a leading space before removing it.
 If the space is missing, a MalformedServerReplyException is thrown.
 This will only happen if the FTP server is not compliant with RFC 3659.

Notable additions:
* The POP3Mail examples can now get password from console, stdin or an environment variable.
* TFTPClient code has been rewritten to improve error handling and retries.

Changes in this version include:
